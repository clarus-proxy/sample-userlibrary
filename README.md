# CLARUS Sample User Library

This repository is used by several CLARUS tools to authenticate users. It provides extremely simple user creation and authentication with NO security (passwords are sent in plain text). This library implements the user authentication API agreed by the CLARUS consortium in order to provide very simple user authentication.

IMPORTANT: This library IS NOT intended to be used in production environments.

## COPILATION
